# project-landing-page
Repo for the landing page project - as part of TOP foundations - flex section.

This project is aimed to display the skills learned during the flexbox module. The website shows a variety of key flexbox features such as:
- centering elements using the main and cross axes.
- using flexbox to create a 'typical' website header with links on either side
- using both row and column flex directions throughout
- using flex grow to ensure boxes fill the required space of their parent element.
- Using flex-shrink 0 to ensure some elements stay the exact size that is required.
- Setting height and width to 'cards' to ensure they remain the right size.
- Using various CSS to use CTA 'pop-up' style pages as well as buttons with round edges, getting rid of bullet points on ULs and underlines on hypertext, to create a more seamless design.
- By completeing this project I also learned how to think of HTML to cater the required parents/elements for flexbox, as well as to make your code easier to read, when laid out properly, usind indentations.

Evaluation: 
- If I was to complete this project again, I would try to use a greater variety of selectors and combining/descendant combinators as most of the selectors I used were classes.
- I would also like to think about the styles which will apply to _all_ of the required elements/sections and apply them using a variety of specificty with selectors as well as more use of grouping selectors.
- I would also like to try to cut down how many divs I use to make the code as efficient as possible, only including the required containers.
